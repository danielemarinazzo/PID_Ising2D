# PID_Ising2D

The information decomposition of the mutual information, as well as those of the transfer entropy, between a target
spin and two neighbors is evaluated according to the approach described in Bertschinger et al., Entropy 16(4), pp. 2161-2183, 2014.

As an example, the file G6spin_256_0.mat contains the probability distribution of six spins, arranged as in the figure below, in the 2D Ising model on a 256x256 lattice with Glauber dynamics, for several values of the coupling beta.

Spin 1 is the target; the two driving spins can be chosen among the remaining 5. In the output figure, the synergy S, the redundancy R, and unique information terms U_1 and U_2 are depicted versus beta.

To run the PID of the mutual information, execute PID_MI; for the PID of the transfer entropy, execute PID_TE (drivers can be
changed by modifying the scripts).
